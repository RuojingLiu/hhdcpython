## The problem

Your colleague would like you to clean up some data for a story about fringe religious groups in Mexico. She doesn't need anything fancy, just an overall count of the number of groups in the country and a count of the number of members per group.

The great news is that Mexican government has collects and releases data about known religious groups. The not-so-great news is that instead of a friendly CSV file, the data is locked up in a [1,964 page PDF document](http://www.asociacionesreligiosas.gob.mx//work/models/AsociacionesReligiosas/pdf/Numeralia/MC_por_SGAR.pdf).
