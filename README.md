# Hacks/Hackers DC Python class instructions

It's your first week as a newsroom coder. A city reporter needs you to clean and summarize some data. One of your colleagues set up a repository with the dataset and an unfinished Python script with some notes.

## Prerequisities (aka requirements)

You'll need to sign up with a couple of services:

* [Github](http://github.com)
* [Python Anywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com)

## Getting set up for the first time

At least your charmingly cryptic co-worker Dave left you a place to start. 

### Fork the code

Forking is a way of making your own version of someone else's code, usually because you want to improve it or modify it for your own purposes.

[Fork the class repository](https://github.com/eads/hhdcpython#fork-destination-box) so you have your own copy of the code to hack on.

(You might think it's weird to digress into Git and version control so quickly. But this tutorial is meant to mimic a professional setting, and you're going to struggle a bit with version control in a professional setting.)
