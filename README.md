# Hacks/Hackers DC Python class instructions

It's your first week as a newsroom coder. A city reporter needs you to clean and summarize some data. One of your colleagues set up a repository with the dataset and an unfinished Python script with some notes.

You'll make a fork of your colleague's work using Git, install your copy on PythonAnywhere, then modify it to process the data.

## Prerequisities

You'll need to sign up with a couple of services to complete this job:

* [Github](http://github.com)
* [Python Anywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com)

## Getting set up for the first time

At least your charmingly cryptic co-worker David left you a place to start: A git repository with some data and the bones of a script to process it.

Of course, he was only following the practices established for any small data project at your company. 

### Fork the code

Forking is a way of making your own version of someone else's code, usually because you want to improve it or modify it for your own purposes. At our company, you should always fork before you work on a project.

[Fork the repository for the class project](https://github.com/eads/hhdcpython#fork-destination-box) so you have your own copy of the code to hack on.

(You might think it's weird to digress into Git and version control so quickly. But this tutorial is meant to mimic a professional setting, and you're going to struggle a bit with version control in a professional setting.)

### Install the code on PythonAnywhere
