## The problem

Your colleague would like you to clean up some data for a story about fringe religious groups in Mexico. She doesn't need anything fancy, just an overall count of the number of groups in the country and a count of the number of members per group.

The good news is that Mexican government has collects and releases data about known religious groups. The not-so-good news is that instead of a friendly CSV file that you could import into Excel, the data is locked up in a [1,964 page PDF document](http://www.asociacionesreligiosas.gob.mx//work/models/AsociacionesReligiosas/pdf/Numeralia/MC_por_SGAR.pdf).

You could try to copy and paste and manually clean up the data, but that's a lot of work. Who wants to do a lot of work? More importantly, you'll have even *more* work if you make a mistake, and if the government releases a new list, you'll have more work still. But if you write some code to clean the data, you can repeatedly process the data. With a little code, mistakes are no longer time-killers. If new data is released, you can simply swap out the old data for the new and re-run your analysis.
